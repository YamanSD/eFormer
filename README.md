- RESTful APIs for managing products, orders, and user information.
- JavaFX interface to demonstrate the APIs

## Technologies Used

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- JDK: v20
- Maven: v3.6.3

## Getting Started

Make sure there are no applications using ports 8080 & 3306.
Navigate to the root directory then:

  - Run `mvn spring-boot:run`
  - Allow incomming connections, if asked.
